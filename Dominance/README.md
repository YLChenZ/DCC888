# Dominance

A node *d* of a control-flow graph dominates a node *n* if every path from the *entry* node to *n* must go through *d*.

## The Assignment

In this lab we shall implement a data-flow analysis to compute dominators.

## Uploading the Assignment

Students enrolled in DCC888 have access to UFMG's grading system, via [Moodle](https://moodle.org/).
You must upload four python files to have your assignment graded: [driver.py](driver.py), [lang.py](lang.py), [parser.py](parser.py) and
[dataflow.py](dataflow.py).
Remember to click on "*Avaliar*" to have your assignment graded.

## Testing without Moodle

As in the previous labs, all the files in this exercise contain `doctest` comments.
You can easily test your implementation by doing, for instance:

```
python3 -m doctest dataflow.py
```

This lab also provides a [folder](tests) with some test cases.
To simulate automatic grading, you can run [drive.py](driver.py) directly, e.g.:

```
python3 driver.py < tests/fib.txt
```
